Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance. 
The process of collisions detection involves sender receiving acknowledgement signals. If there is just one signal(its own) then the data is successfully sent 
but if there are two signals(its own and the one with which it has collided) then it means a collision has occurred. 
To distinguish between these two cases, collision must have a lot of impact on received signal.
However it is not so in wired networks, so CSMA/CA is used in this case.
